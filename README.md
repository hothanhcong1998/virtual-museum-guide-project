# Virtual Museum Tour Guide

The Virtual Museum Tour Guide is a project that utilizes machine learning techniques to create a virtual tour guide that can provide visitors with information about museum objects. The project leverages the Louvre Abu Dhabi dataset, which contains videos and information about museum objects, to build a sample virtual tour guide.
