It was made in Jordan over 8000 years ago. It might represent a pair ot deities or common ancestors venerated by one of the first village communities in the Levant. Thirty-two similar statues have been found on the Ain Ghazal site, some embellished with painted patterns and accessories such as wigs. They were probably used in ritual ceremonies."
0002,Female figure: fertility symbol (from Syria),1,"Syria, Tell Halaf",6000-5100 BCE,height 5.6 cm,modelled and painted terracotta,"Female figure: fertility symbol (from Syria and Ecuador): one is over 7000 years old and comes from Mesopotamia in the north of modern-day Iraq, the other comes from Ecuador on the American continent and is 4000 years old. Despite their aesthetic differences, these female figures both have rounded shapes. This physical trait is found in most early figures created worldwide in the period when the first villages were appearing. They were probably intended to convey a symbolic message associated with fecundity and fertility."

0005,Female figure wearing a necklace,1,"Pakistan, Balochistan",2800-2700 BCE,height 10 cm,modelled terracotta,"This small terracotta statuette with pronounced feminine contours most likely symbolises fertility. She wears a kind of mask in the shape of a bird on her head, which suggests she is from the world of the gods or spirits. This type of figurine is typical of the Mehrgarh village culture that flourished in the Indus Valley (now Pakistan) from the 6th to the 2nd millennium BCE."

0010,Cooking jar with corded pattern decoration,1,"Jomon culture, Japan, North Kanto",3500-2500 BCE,height 54.5 cm,terracotta,"This vase is characteristic of a type of pottery that was developed in Japan during the Neolithic period. At the time of its creation, the potter's wheel had not yet been invented so the craftsmen fashioned the vase by stacking clay rings. After smoothing its surface, they decorated it by pressing the clay with cords, bamboo and shells. The stylised motifs that adorn the opening of the vase suggest natural elements such as water and fire and belong to the vast decorative repertoire of the Jomon potters."

Its painted decoration is typical of the Mesopotamian ceramics that were produced in southern Iraq from 6500 BCE. Thus its presence on the shores of the Emirates indicates that it was an imported item. As such, it also attests the early development of marine traffic in the Gulf, over 7000 years ago."

The craftsman has produced it in several stages with great dexterity. This blade, with its razor-sharp edge, has been struck from a block of flint using a variety of implements. However, it is too delicate to be used without shattering and probably never saw service. This object may have had a symbolic purpose to boast the great skill of the person who produced it."

0020,Bi disc for ritual use,1,China,2300-1500 BCE,,jade,"It comes from China, dates from around 2000 BCE. It was carved from jade, a symbol of immortality, and was thought to protect the corpse of the deceased. This object and the object code 0021 are from the Neolithic period, during which human communities experienced profound changes as they became more hierarchical and many signs of social differentiation appeared."
0021,Disc ring: status symbol,1,"France, Volnay",About 4000 BCE,,jadeite,"It is a pierced disc discovered in France, dates from around 4000 BCE. We do not know exactly what purpose it served, but the craftsmanship and precious material suggest that this object was an indicator of social prestige."

They had been placed as offerings in collective tombs dating from the Umm an-Nar period (2400-2000 BCE).

This type of model boat was placed in the tombs of the Egyptian elite so that they might continue to travel by river in the afterlife. It would also allow them to cross the heavens and the underworld in the company of the gods, and provide them with safe passage to the land of the dead."

In Egyptian mythology, the animal could embody benign or malevolent deities, depending on whether it was female or male. Juvenile animals embodied the Nun, the primordial swamp that the Egyptians believed to be the origin of life. Figurines like this were placed in tombs to ensure that a person would be reborn in the afterlife."

0048,Funerary servant for Pharaoh Seti I,2,"Egypt civilization, Egypt, Valley of the Kings",About 1290 BCE,height 22.9 cm,faience,"This figurine with its discreet smile and delicate features has an unusually serene face. The fine quality of the craftsmanship, bright blue earthenware, and the pharaoh's headdress show that it belonged to a member of the Egyptian elite, and more specifically Pharaoh Seti I. This statuette, which was placed in his tomb, depicts a servant who worked the land, as is clear from the agricultural implements he is holding. Egyptians believed that they would continue to farm the land in the afterlife to provide food."

The scenes depicted are taken from the Book of the Dead, a collection of magic spells to accompany the deceased on their journey to the next life. After a number of trials and stages, the dead person could progress to the afterlife. This woven linen was less expensive than papyrus, thus proving that funeral rites were carried out across all social strata."
0052,Sarcopagus of Henuttawy: coffins and mummy's wrapping,2,"Egypt civilization, Egypt",950-900 BCE,,"painted wood, stuccoed and painted cloth","This remarkably well-preserved cartonnage, which was originally enclosed inside three other sarcophagi, covered the body of the Egyptian princess Henuttawy, who lived in the early first millennium BCE. The deceased woman's status as a royal princess explains the richness and complexity of the decoration, which includes inscriptions, depictions of deities, and various forms of ornamentation. For ancient Egyptians, preserving the body and name of the deceased was essential in order to ensure access to the afterlife and survival there."
0053,"Gudea, prince of Lagash",2,"Neo-Sumerian kingdom, Iraq, Girsu (modern Tello)",About 2120 BCE,height 107 cm,black stone,"These are statues of two sovereigns, Gudea (code 0053), a Mesopotamian ruler of the kingdom of Lagash, and the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II (code 0054). The two royal effigies depict different concepts of power. Gudea, with his hands clasped, is portrayed as a humble and pious king who sateguards the prosperity of his people. The Egyptian pharaoh, by contrast, was both god and man, an absolute ruler who presided over the smooth running of the world and the stability of the cosmos."

He can be identified by his crown and is depicted in two separate scenes: on the left, he is presenting offerings to the god Osiris, and on the right he is receiving them from a high-ranking official. The official addresses the young pharaoh with a phrase conferring divine protection. Tutankhamun is depicted symmetrically here as man and god simultaneously, acting as a force to ensure order in the world."
0056,Cuirass,2,"France, Marmesse",1000-800 BCE,height 49 cm,bronze,"The purpose of this bronze breastplate dating from the gth or gth century BCE was largely ceremonial. At that time, warrior castes all over Europe attributed sacred power to their weapons. The decoration, emphasising the contours ot the wearer's chest, exaggerated the owner's anatomy as a mark of his prestige. However, it shows no signs of having been used in battle. The grimacing mask on the plastron at the front had a symbolic protective function."

The fine detail on this weapon shows great mastery of the bronze worker's craft. This obiect comes from Luristan, a region in modern-day Iran, situated at the intersection of various metal deposits and on the routes between Central Asia and Mesopotamia. It dates from around 1000 BCE, when Luristan was a major metalworking centre. Highly skilled artisans produced all types of weapons for the new warrior aristocracy."

It has a painted pattern of deer and lions on the lower part and horsemen riding slowly at the top. At the time the bowl was made, only the elite rode horses in Greece, so from the 6th century BCE aristocrats often had themselves depicted on horseback. Such was the prestige involved that horsemen were one of the commonest motifs on the ceramics of the period."

In the Greek world these hybrid creatures had a commemorative function. Placed at the top of a column, this sculpture probably protected a burial site. The sphinx was introduced into Greece from the oriental bestiary in the 9th century BCE. It was replaced by human figures at the beginning of the 5th century BCE and disappeared from the repertoire of Greek sculpture."

His huge palace in Susa, in modern-day Iran, was lavishly decorated, notably with a frieze featuring a multitude of archers similar to this one. Under his rule, the Achaemenid empire was at its peak, extending from Egypt to the Indus, and from Central Asia to the borders of the Arabian Peninsula, forming one of the largest territories ever united under the control of a sovereign."

0078,Amphora decorated with warriors,3,"Greece, Athens, The Princeton Painter",About 550 BCE,,painted terracotta,"The two black figures on this amphora depict an episode from the myth of the twelve labours of Heracles. Here, the Greek hero is fighting the Nemean lion, which was believed to be invincible. In ancient Greek culture, painters liked to draw inspiration from mythology to depict this type of scene on banquetware. This decoration with black figures on a red background is attributed to the painter Antimenes, who was at his peak around 520 BCE, in an era when the ""red-figure"" technique was being established."

Although incomplete, it perfectly illustrates the exploration of form carried out by Greek sculptors of that period, which is considered the apogee of Classical sculpture. The powerful musculature and dynamic ""contrapposto"" pose, in which the body rests on its left leg, are characteristic of an ideal of male beauty that left a lasting impression on Western sculpture."

The Nok culture flourished in West Africa in the centuries prior to the first millennium, where it exerted considerable influence. The sophistication of this object suggests a long artistic tradition. Furthermore, Nok art demonstrates the ancient roots of human depictions in African art."

In Greece, the philosopher Socrates was the first person to explore the nature of humans as autonomous individuals and as social beings. In China, Confucius placed humankind at the heart of his thinking and developed a system of morality aimed at creating social harmony. Lastly, in Pakistan, the figure of Buddha promoted a form of spirituality in which a balance was established between mind and body, thus freeing humanity from all forms of desire and greed."

Empires often sought to associate themselves with this powerful motif throughout history. However, this sculpture in the classical Chinese bronze-making tradition owes its dynamic and lifelike appearance to the art of the nomadic peoples, of what is now the Mongolian steppe, who lived on the borders of the northern provinces of China where this work was most probably made."

They are modelled on Egyptian sarcophagi that Phoenician kings brought back for their own burials from military campaigns. A number of high-ranking Phoenicians then had their own sarcophagi made in marble. The first is strongly influenced by Egyptian art, especially the headdress, whereas the other is Greek-influenced and more naturalistic."

0097,Image of a queen or goddess,3,"Egypt civilization, Egypt",360-282 BCE,,black stone,"This Egyptian bas-relief depicts the profile of a woman, probably a deity or queen, wearing a vulture headdress. In ancient Egypt, this bird of prey was the animal attribute of many female deities. The Egyptians considered it to be a symbol of motherhood. They believed that vultures were always female and were fertilised by the wind. Furthermore, the roughness of the rock in some areas suggests that this is a fragment of a sculpture which was deliberately left unfinished."
0098,Funerary portrait of a man with a cup,3,"Roman empire, Egypt, Antinopolis",225-250 CE,height 23 cm,wax paint on wood,"With its emaciated face, furrowed brow and dark-ringed eyes, this 3rd-century CE portrait strives to be very realistic and is an example of the Roman tradition in its purest form. However, this portrait is actually Egyptian in origin and was created to cover the face of a mummified body, replacing the funerary masks of the pharaonic tradition. In 30 BCE, Egypt became a province of the Roman empire and different traditions blended during this period."

Augustus can be recognised by the artfully arranged locks of his hair, his high forehead, prominent cheekbones and determined chin. He deliberately chose to be portrayed with severe-looking features, which heightened his authority and charisma. The official image of the emperor was circulated widely across the Roman empire, through sculptures but also on coins bearing his effigy."
0100,"Head of a Roman emperor, fragment from a monumental statue",3,"Roman empire, Italy, Rome",About 200 CE,,gilded bronze,"This male head with its intense gaze inspires a feeling of peace. However, it bears witness to a turbulent episode in the history of Rome in Italy. It probably depicts Clodius Albinus, a short-lived emperor from the second century CE. The head is the only surviving section of his monumental statue and the marks around the base suggest that it was probably decapitated. This was a period of fierce power struggles in the Roman Empire. When Septimus Severus became emperor, he destroyed depictions of his predecessor, in a similar manner to the fate of this striking head."

It is a stunning example of animal art from the Han dynasty, which dominated a large part of modern-day China from 25 to 206 CE. The horse is an allegory of the aristocracy. Used for war and as a symbol of prestige, the horse is also included Chinese mythology. This type of figurine, a symbol of blessings from heaven, is found in the graves of high-ranking figures."

The art of mosaics originated in the Greek world and became immensely popular all across the empire during the Roman era, with regional styles developing. These two scenes, for example, illustrate the repertoire of the African workshops, with their reference to the circus with the racing 'cupids' mounted on fish, and the taste for parody that emerges in the figures of the monkey musicians."

They show the influence that Greek art, diffused by the conquests of Alexander the Great, continued to have over the centuries and across a vast geographical area. In the 4th century BCE, Alexander's empire stretched from the Mediterranean to the borders of India. The sculpture on the left is Roman while the one on the right is from Gandhara, in what is now Pakistan. They show that, from the same source, the two geographically separate cultures developed very different aesthetics."

In the Middle Ages, churches were extremely bright as colour was considered to be light, which was believed to emanate from the divine. Because they supported the building and, by extension, the ecclesial institution, columns were of great symbolic value, in addition to their architectural function. This is why architects used them so abundantly in religious buildings and sculptors decorated them in painstaking detail and with bright colours."
0116,Red sandstone Buddha head in India,5,"Gupta empire, Northern India, Mathura region",400-500,,red sandstone,"Carved out of a block of red sandstone, this head depicts the Buddha deep in meditation. His eyes half-closed and lowered, it seems as if he is no longer of this world. The Buddha's inward-looking gaze is characteristic of the aesthetic of the Gupta era in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, the golden age of Indian civilisation. From an artistic point of view, this period was a phase of classicism, marked by a subtle balance between realism and the idealisation of forms."
0117,White marble Buddha head in China,5,"Eastern Wei or Northern Qi dynasty, Northern China ",530-580,height 51 cm,white marble,"Sculpted in the mid-6th century, this Buddha head in white marble came from a temple or chapel in northern China. Buddhism was introduced to China in the 1st century, brought from India by pilgrims and traders travelling along the Silk Road. In the north of the country it led to the construction of colossal monasteries, founded, in some cases, at the direct initiative of the sovereigns."

0119,Mirror case of imperial provenance,5,"Tang dynasty, China, from the Shoso-in collection of Japan",700-800,diameter 38.5 cm,"wood, tortoiseshell, mother of pearl, amber","This wooden box, decorated with slivers of tortoiseshell and inlaid with painted amber beads, comes from one of the most brilliant periods of Chinese civilisation, during the Tang dynasty. The dynasty, which reigned between the 7th and 10th centuries, corresponded to a veritable golden age in the arts. The decorative repertoire is reminiscent of the art of the Persian Sassanid empire, with which the Chinese empire had a relationship."
0120,Dish decorated with plant motifs,5,"Tang dynasty, China",About 800,diameter 24.5 cm,silver gilt,"This covered bowl crafted entirely from gold and silver is illustrative of the magnificent work produced by Chinese goldsmiths under the Tang dynasty that ruled China between 618 and 907 CE, a period considered the golden age of Chinese civilisation. The dynasty's capital, Chang'an, was one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. The decoration of flower and fruit motifs, and the technique used to make the bowl, reveal the influence of Persian Sassanid goldsmiths, whose work inspired Chinese craftsmen during that period."
0121,Ewer decorated with the signs of zodiac,5,"Afghanistan, Herat",About 1220,height 38cm,"copper alloy, silver","The decoration of this ewer illustrates the twelve signs of the Zodiac. They are represented on each of the twelve faces of its belly, along with formulae of good wishes to the object's owner. The ewer is a technical masterpiece, hammered from a single sheet of brass. The handle is the only part that was individually cast and soldered to the neck and the belly. The decoration was then chased, worked with a repousse technique, and inlaid with silver."
0122,Chamfered vase with royal crane motifs (Lajvardina decoration),5,Iran,About 1300,height 34.2cm,"ceramic, painted overglaze decoration with gold highlights","This vase is characteristic of the ceremonial ceramic ware developed in the Iranian world in the late 13th century. It combines a typically Persian decorative technique, known as lajvardina, with Chinese-inspired motifs like the grey-crowned crane on each of its sides. This syncretism illustrates the renewal of Iranian ceramic production under the likhanid dynasty (1256-1353) founded by the grandson of the great Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, which had conquered and reunified Iran during the 13th century."
0123,Basin inscribed with the name of Bonifilius,6,Northern Italy,About 1300,diameter 137 cm,marble,"This ablution basin was decorated by the sculptor Bonifilius with various animals of ambivalent symbolic significance: lions, as a symbol of power, were sometimes positive and sometimes negative in the Middle Ages, as were dragons. The porcupine, however, was a symbol of avarice for a long time before coming to represent military valour. Inside the basin is a salamander, a creature that could extinguish any flame. So the decoration evokes the struggle between good and evil, echoing water's role of purifying the faithful before prayer."
0124,"Basin inscribed with the name of Hugh of Lusignan, king of Cyprus",6,"Mamluk sultanate, Syria or Egypt",1324-1359,,copper alloy with decoration in silver and organic matter,"This bowl was created by Mamluk craftsmen for the king of Cyprus, Hugh IV of Lusignan, in the mid-14h century. It is one of the few surviving objects demonstrating the diplomatic relations that existed at the time between the last Christian sovereigns in the eastern Mediterranean and the Mamluk dynasty, whose territory ranged from modern-day Libya to Syria. Hugh of Lusignan's ancestors reigned over Jerusalem in the late 12Th century during the Crusades."
0125,Collar of the order of the golden fleece,6,"Flanders (today northern France, Belgium and part of the Netherlands)",1500-1600,length 118cm,gold and enamel,"This ram hanging from a chain is a reference to the Greek myth of the Golden Fleece. It was worn to indicate membership of the Order of the Golden Fleece, an order of knighthood established in the late 15th century. The concept of knighthood emerged a few centuries earlier in the West. Knights, who were specialists in combat on horseback, became a hereditary caste within feudal society. Initially created to participate in the defence of Christendom, the orders of knights subsequently became a political power and formed a kind of royal council."
0126,Turban helmet,6,"Aq-qoyunlu or Ottoman, Turkey",1450-1500,height 61cm,"steel with silver inlays, traces of gold","This turban-helmet belongs to a group of helmets worn in the Persian world and Anatolia from the 14th to the 16th century. It owes its name to the way in which it could be worn, over a turban, but also to its twisted shape, reminiscent of the way in which hair might be twisted. An inscription on the upper part, inspired by Sufi mysticism, imbues the helmet with the symbolic power of protection. The elegance of the item suggests it was used essentially for ceremonial purposes."
0127,Monumental Lion: An acoustic automation,6,Southern Spain or sourthern Italy,1000-1200,,bronze,"This bronze lion, a masterpiece of Islamic sculpture, was probably an automaton that made sounds like a big cat roaring. Muslim sovereigns and scientists were fascinated by this type of object, which was likely invented in the 11th century in the Mediterranean basin. A symbol of bravery, majesty and strength, the lion has been associated with figures of power since ancient times. It is therefore frequently depicted as the guardian of a throne, temple or tomb."

The incarnation of God as Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to atone for humankind's sins, is at the core of the Christian faith. This 15""h century work, which is intimate in appearance, was intended as an aid for meditation and private devotion. The painter, Giovanni Bellini, brought his figures to life with chiaroscuro effects of shadow and light. He also used oil paint, a technique borrowed from Flemish artists. In Italy, this novel approach set Venice apart from the other centres of artistic activity."
0131,Picture: Virgin and Child of Francesco Traini,6,Italy,About 1325,"height 67.5 cm, width 56 cm",tempera on panel,"This Virgin and Child painted by the 14th century artist Francesco Traini lies at the meeting point between two traditions, Byzantine and Italian. The gold colour of the background and the subject are characteristic of the Byzantine tradition. The small religious images known as icons had come to Europe from Constantinople a century earlier. Artists were inspired by these works whilst also introducing new characteristics, such as expression of feeling and a wealth of detail. So this painting is part of the great revolution undertaken by the Italian Primitives."

In the 1920s, the Dutch painter developed an art based on elementary principles: straight lines, areas separated from each other, and the three primary colours (red, yellow, blue) and the two non-colours (black and white). By emancipating himself from the need to represent reality, Mondrian emerged as one of the pioneers of abstract art in the early 20th century."
0147,Picture: Bindu,0,"Sayed Haider Raza, France or India",1986,"height 120 cm, width 120 cm",acrylic on canvas,"This painting by the Indian artist Syed Haider Raza is a simple composition with a subtle combination of colours. The large black circle depicts a Bindu, the symbol of life in Hindu belief, to which the artist is particularly attached both formally and spiritually. Raza trained in France in the 1950s and embraced Western avant-garde art, and abstraction in particular. His work demonstrates his dual Indian and European heritage."
0148,Picture: Crystal,0,"Frantisek Kupka, France, Puteaux",1919-1920,,oil on canvas,"With this eruption of black and brown shapes and yellow and orange swirls, Czech painter Frantisek Kupka seems depict the vital force of creation in his painting entitled Cristal. The artist believed that a work of art was abstract and should therefore be composed of invented elements. Here, he draws his inspiration from the organic world to suggest that the work is a living organism. Frantisek Kupka belonged to the Abstract art movement at a time in the early 20th century when only a small number of Russian and European painters pursued this path."
