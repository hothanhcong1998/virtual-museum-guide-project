The First Villages,Room 1,"Some 10,000 years ago, when most of the world's population were still hunter-gatherers, the first villages appeared in the Levant and Mesopotamia, and then later on in China and America. In these regions, communities settled while agriculture and animal husbandry developed. At the same time, new beliefs appeared and hierarchical order began to arise in societies. This new form of organisation led to the emergence of technological innovations. These phenomena are referred to as the Neolithic Revolution."
The First Great Powers,Room 2,"In the 4th millennium BCE, a key stage occurred in the history of humanity - the urban revolution or the appearance of the first towns in southern Mesopotamia and other regions of the world. This phenomenon was accompanied by major innovations such as the invention of writing and also the rise of the first sovereigns. Against this backdrop, the arts and crafts, and metallurgy in particular, became more sophisticated and trade increased. The use of horses, which were gradually domesticated, and displays of sporting and military prowess spread throughout the major Eurasian civilisations."
Civilization and Empires,Room 3,"The earliest civilisations appeared in the 1st millennium BCE. Certain societies, like the Achaemenid empire in Persia, the Greek civilisation on the shores of the Mediterranean, and the Olmec culture in Central America, extended their control over territory and exerted a cultural influence across extensive areas. Several centuries later, these cultural areas passed into the hands of major powers like the Roman empire and the Qin and Han dynasties in China, which unified and extended them, and imposed their own political, economic, and social systems."
Universal Religions,Room 4,"From Late Antiquity to the 15th century, ""universal"" religions made their mark. Buddhism appeared in India in the 5th century BCE, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman empire in the 4th century, and Islam came into being in the 7th century in Arabia. These religions had certain founding principles in common and were to have a far-reaching influence on the societies which adopted them. Artistic output subsequently developed a religious dimension."
Silk Roads,Room 5,"From the 5th to the 15th centuries, trade between Asia, the Islamic world and Europe developed significantly using Central Asian land routes and Indian Ocean sea routes. China and the Islamic world made their mark as key players in trade, transporting raw materials, manufactured goods, textiles, items made of gold, and incense. This large-scale movement of goods promoted the spread of currents of thought, techniques and decorative schemes. Islamic and European artistic output was therefore informed by a variety of influences."
From the Mediterranean to the Atlantic,Room 6,"Over a period of ten centuries, the Byzantine empire, Christian Europe and the Islamic world presided over artistic exchanges and trade in the Mediterranean basin: the powerful Byzantine world influenced European and Islamic aesthetics, ancient learning was circulated via the Muslim-controlled Iberian Peninsula; and the first financial markets developed in Europe. But these three worlds were also political and religious rivals. This era came to an end in the late 15th century, as a new chapter in history began with the discovery of the New World and the exploration of the African coasts."
